# Lightbend Pipelines Workshop

## Getting Started

### Resolve Dependencies


Import/Open `./java/1-start` or `./scala/1-start` in IntelliJ (or whichever IDE you prefer) and let the IDE pick up the `build.sbt` and resolve dependencies

Optionally, you can also `cd` into `./java/1-start` or `./scala/1-start` and run 

```
sbt compile
```

Which will also resolve the project dependencies for you.

### Running Locally

To confirm everything is working locally `cd` into `./java/1-start` or `./scala/1-start` and run 

```
sbt runLocal
```

You should see output that ends with:

```
Running pipelines-workshop-[your name] 
To terminate, press [ENTER]
```

You're all Set!
